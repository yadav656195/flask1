    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "Flask Framework:\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is lightweight and modular. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, \n",
    "\n",
    "allowing developers to build web applications quickly and with minimal code. Flask provides the essentials for building a\n",
    "web application, but it leaves many decisions to the developer, giving them the flexibility to choose components and libraries \n",
    "based on their project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight and Easy to Learn: Flask has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, making it accessible for beginners. It doesn't \n",
    "impose any specific way of doing things, allowing developers to choose their preferred tools and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Flask is designed with a modular approach, allowing developers to use only the components they need. This makes the\n",
    "framework highly customizable and adaptable to different project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask can be extended easily by integrating various third-party extensions and libraries. This flexibility enables \n",
    "developers to add features as needed without bloating the core framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it convenient for testing and debugging\n",
    "applications during the development phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large and Active Community: Flask has a large and active community, which means there is ample documentation, tutorials,\n",
    "and community support available. Developers can find solutions to common problems and get assistance from the community."
